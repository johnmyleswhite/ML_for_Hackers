# Purpose:         Code for Chapter 4.  In this case study we will attempt to write a "priority
#                   inbox" algorithm for ranking email by some measures of importance.  We will
#                   define these measures based on a set of email features, which moves beyond
#                   the simple work counts used in Chapter 3.
# Data Used:       Email messages contained in ../../03-Classification/code/data/
