The first edition of this book, <i>Programming Perl,</i> hit the shelves in 1990, and was quickly adopted as the  undisputed bible of the language. Since then, Perl  has grown with the times, and so has this book.<i>Programming Perl</i> is not just a book about Perl. It is  also a unique introduction to the language and its culture,  as one might expect only from its authors. Larry Wall is the inventor of Perl, and provides a unique perspective on  the evolution of Perl and its future direction. Tom Christiansen was one of the first champions of the language,  and lives and breathes the complexities of Perl internals  as few other mortals do. Jon Orwant is the editor of <i>The Perl Journal,</i> which has brought together the Perl  community as a common forum for new developments in Perl.Any Perl book can show the syntax of Perl's functions, but only this one is a comprehensive guide to all the nooks and crannies of the language. Any Perl book can explain typeglobs, pseudohashes, and closures, but only this one shows  how they really work. Any Perl book can say that <i>my</i> is faster than <i>local,</i> but only this one explains why. Any Perl book  can have a title, but only this book is affectionately known by all Perl programmers as ""The Camel.""  This third edition of <i>Programming Perl</i> has been expanded to cover version 5.6 of this maturing language. New topics include threading, the compiler, Unicode, and other  new features that have been added since the previous edition."9781565923928.IP,"Javascript: The Definitive Guide, 3E",9781565923928,2,"JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that can be embedded directly in HTML. It allows you to create dynamic, interactive Web-based applications that run completely within a Web browser; you don't have to do any server-side programming, like writing CGI scripts.  JavaScript is a simpler language than Java. It can be embedded directly in Web pages without compilation, so it is more flexible and easier to use for simple tasks like animation. However, although you can write reasonably robust and complete Web applications using JavaScript alone, JavaScript is not a substitute for Java. In fact, JavaScript is a good client-side complement to Java; using the two together allows you to create more complex applications than are possible with JavaScript alone.<i>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</i> provides a thorough description of the core JavaScript language and its client-side framework, complete with sophisticated examples that show you how to handle common tasks, like validating form data and working with cookies. The book also contains a definitive, in-depth reference section that covers every core and client-side JavaScript function, object, method, property, constructor, and event handler. This book is an indispensable reference for all JavaScript programmers, regardless of experience level.This third edition of <i>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</i> describes the latest version of the language, JavaScript 1.2, as supported by Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 4. The book also covers JavaScript 1.1, which is the first industry-standard version known as ECMAScript. The new features of JavaScript 1.2, which are likely to be embodied in a later ECMAScript standard release, are clearly indicated, so that you can use them as appropriate in your scripts."9780596007126.IP,Head First Design Patterns,9780596007126,3,"You're not alone.<br /><br />At any given moment, somewhere in the world someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. You know you don't want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns--the lessons learned by those who've faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on...something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun.<br /><br />You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don't just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look ""in the wild"". In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java's built-in pattern support in your own code.<br /><br />You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead).  You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you're up a creek without a design pattern.<br /><br />Most importantly, you want to learn the ""secret language"" of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You'll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn't as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter.<br /><br />With <i>Head First Design Patterns</i>, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the ""Trading Spaces"" show. Best of all, in a way that won't put you to sleep!  We think your time is too important (and too short) to spend it struggling with academic texts.<br /><br />If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, <i>Head First Design Patterns</i> will load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks. In a way that lets you put them to work immediately. In a way that makes you better at solving software design problems, and better at speaking the language of patterns with others on your team."9780596009205.IP,"Head First Java, 2E",9780596009205,4,"Learning a complex new language is no easy task especially when it s an object-oriented computer programming language like Java.  You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. <br /><br />The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. <br /><br />That's how your brain knows.<br /><br />And that's how your brain will learn Java. <i>Head First Java</i> combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java.  You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI.  And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform.  Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required.  So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. <br /><br />If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read.<br /><br />By exploiting how your brain works, <i>Head First Java</i> compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information.  Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you."9780596529529.IP,Mac OS X Leopard: The Missing Manual,9780596529529,5,"With Leopard, Apple has unleashed the greatest version of Mac OS X yet, and David Pogue is back with another meticulous Missing Manual to cover the operating system with a wealth of detail.

Today, Java servlets stand poised to take Java to the next level as a Web development language. The main reason is that servlets offer a fast, powerful, portable replacement for CGI scripts.The Java Servlet API, introduced as the first standard extension to Java, provides a generic mechanism to extend the functionality of any kind of server. Servlets are most commonly used, however, to extend Web servers, performing tasks traditionally handled by CGI programs. Web servers that can support servlets include: Apache, Netscape's FastTrack and Enterprise Servers, Microsoft's IIS, O'Reilly's WebSite, and JavaSoft's Java Web Server.The beauty of servlets is that they execute within the Web server's process space and they persist between invocations. This gives servlets tremendous performance benefits over CGI programs. Yet because they're written in Java, servlets are far less likely to crash a Web server than a C-based NSAPI or ISAPI extension. Servlets have full access to the various Java APIs and to third-party component classes, making them ideal for use in communicating with applets, databases, and RMI servers. Plus, servlets are portable between operating systems and between servers -- with servlets you can ""write once, serve everywhere.""<i>Java Servlet Programming</i> covers everything you need to know to write effective servlets and includes numerous examples that you can use as the basis for your own servlets. The book explains the servlet life cycle, showing how you can use servlets to maintain state information effortlessly.  It also describes how to serve dynamic Web content, including both HTML pages and multimedia data. Finally, it explores more advanced topics like integrated session tracking, efficient database connectivity using JDBC, applet-servlet communication, inter-servlet communication, and internationalization."9780596522353.IP,slide:ology,9780596522346,27,"No matter where you are on the organizational ladder, the odds are high that you've delivered a high-stakes presentation to your peers, your boss, your customers, or the general public.

It shows how JavaScript and PHP can be used in tandem to make a user's experience faster and more pleasant. It shows the correct way to handle errors in user input so that a site looks professional. It introduces the vast collection of powerful tools available in the PEAR repository and shows how to use some of the most popular tools.Even while it serves as an introduction to new programmers, the book does not omit critical tasks that web sites require. For instance, every site that allows updates must handle the possibility of multiple users accessing data at the same time. This book explains how to solve the problem in detail with locking.Through a sophisticated sample application--Hugh and Dave's Wine Store--all the important techniques of dynamic content are introduced. Good design is emphasized, such as dividing logic from presentation.

Many content creators and programmers for the Web and other media are left wondering, ""What can XML and its associated standards really do for me?"" Getting the most from XML requires being able to tag and transform XML documents so they can be processed by web browsers, databases, mobile phones, printers, XML processors, voice response systems, and LDAP directories, just to name a few targets.In <i>Learning XML,</i> the author explains XML and its capabilities succinctly and professionally, with references to real-life projects and other cogent examples. <i>Learning XML</i> shows the purpose of XML markup itself, the CSS and XSL styling languages, and the XLink and XPointer specifications for creating rich link structures.The basic advantages of XML over HTML are that XML lets a web designer define tags that are meaningful for the particular documents or database output to be used, and that it enforces an unambiguous structure that supports error-checking. XML supports enhanced styling and linking standards (allowing, for instance, simultaneous linking to the same document in multiple languages) and a range of new applications.For writers producing XML documents, this book demystifies files and the process of creating them with the appropriate structure and format.
