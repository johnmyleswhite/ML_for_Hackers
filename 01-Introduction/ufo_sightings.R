# Author:          Drew Conway (drew.conway@nyu.edu)
# Purpose:         Code for Chapter 1.  In this case we will review some of the basic
#                   R functions and coding paradigms we will use throughout this book.
#                   This includes loading, viewing, and cleaning raw data; as well as
#                   some basic visualization.  This specific case we will use data from
#                   reported UFO sightings to investigate what, if any, seasonal trends
#                   exists in the data.
# Data Used:       http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/60000-documented-ufo-sightings-with-text-descriptions-and-metada
# Packages Used:   ggplot2

# This is a tab-delimited file, so we use 'read.delim' and set the separator as a tab character.

# factor types; and, this data has does not have header labels in the first row, so
# we want to keep the first row as data.

# To work with the dates, we will need to convert the YYYYMMDD string to an R Date
# type using the 'strptime' function

# But, something has gone wrong with the data. For now, we'll just ignore the errata
# by removing those entries that have not parsed correctly.  We know that the date 
# strings are always 8 characters long, and any deviation from this would indicate
# a row to ignore.  We will use the 'ifelse' function to construct a vector of
# Booleans indicating the problem rows

# It will be useful to create separate columns for both town and state from the Location 
# column.  To do so we will use the 'strsplit' function to perform the regex.
# Note: not every entry in Location is of the form 'City, State'.  We use the
# 'tryCatch' function to simply return [NA, NA] when this is the case.  Next,
# we remove the leading white-space from both the city and state strings with 'gsub'

# Now, we are ready to do some analysis!  First, take a look at the post-processed data

head(ufo.us)

# The summary functions shows us that the data actually go back a very long time (1440!).  So, 
# we will want to take a quick look at the date to see where the majority of the data exists.
# We can do this by creating a histogram of frequencies for UFO sightings over time
quick.hist <- ggplot(ufo.us, aes(x = DateOccurred)) +

# First, we notice that there are many very old entries in the data.  For our purposes, we will only look
# at incidents that occurred from 1990 to the most recent

# Let's look at the histogram now

# Now that we have the data we want, let's look at some aggregations.  We will use
# the 'ddply' funtion in the plyr package. But first, we create a column of just
# the Year-Month of each incident.
ufo.us$YearMonth <- strftime(ufo.us$DateOccurred, format = "%Y-%m")

# This will return the number of sightings of UFO by Year-Month and state for the whole time-series

# As we might expect, there are several Year-Month and state combinations for which there are no 
# UFO sightings.  We need to count these as zero so we can go back and fill those in.
# First, we will create a new vector that has all of the Year-Month dates in it that span the

# We use 'merge' to take the counts we have and merge them with the missing dates.  Note, we have to specify
# the columns from each data frame we are using to do the merge, and set 'all' to TRUE, which will fill in 
# this missing dates from the original data frame with NA.

                       all = TRUE)

# Now we just need to clean up the merged data frame a bit
# Set the column names to something meaningful

# There are lots of ways we could test the seasonality of of these sightings, but one basic method is to 
# inspect the trends visually.  We now construct a plot that will show these trends for all 50 U.S. states
# over the time-series.

# First we have to create a ggplot2 object and then create a geom layer, which in this case is a line.
# Additional points of note:
# (1) facet_wrap() will create separate plots for each state on a 10x5 grid.
# (2) theme_bw() changes the default ggplot2 style from grey to white (personal preference).
# (3) scale_color_manual() sets the line color to dark blue.
# (4) scale_x_date() scales the x-axis as a date, with major lines every 5 years.
# (5) xlab() and ylab() set axis labels.
# (6) opts() sets a title for the plot
