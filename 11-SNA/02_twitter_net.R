# File-Name:       twitter_net.R
# Date:            2012-02-10
# Author:          Drew Conway (drew.cownway@nyu.edu)
# Purpose:         File 2 for code in Chapter 11.  In this short file we write code for generating the 
#                   the ego-network for a given Twitter user.  Once the network object has been built we
#                   add some vertex level attributs, and clean the graph by extracting the 2-corre.  Finally,
#                   we perform a hierarchical clustering analysis of the nodes as a distance-based community
#                   detection.  We then add these node partitions to the nodes, and save the files as GaphML.

#### AS OF 2012-01-19 IT APPEARS THAT TWITTER.COM ####
#### HAS CHANGED HOW IT INTERACTS WITH THE GOOGLE ####
